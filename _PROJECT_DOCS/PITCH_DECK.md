## AI-Powered Agricultural Traceability on Hedera

---

## Slide 1: The Problem

### ðŸŒ¾ Agricultural Supply Chain Challenges

**Trust Gap in Food Systems:**
- Consumers can't verify organic/premium claims
- Farmers struggle to prove quality and get fair prices
- Supply chain fraud costs $40B+ annually
- Manual traceability is slow, expensive, and error-prone

**Current Solutions Fall Short:**
- Paper certificates â†’ easily forged
- Centralized databases â†’ single point of failure
- Blockchain alone â†’ data is immutable but not intelligent

**The Missing Piece:** *AI-powered provenance analysis that turns blockchain data into actionable trust*

## Demo Script (2 Minutes)

### Setup
- Backend running on http://localhost:4000
- Frontend on http://localhost:5173
- Demo NFT already seeded

### Script

**[0:00-0:30] Introduction**
> "Hi, I'm demonstrating AgriTrustâ€”an AI-powered agricultural traceability platform built on Hedera. We combine blockchain immutability with Gemini AI intelligence to create trust in food supply chains."

**[0:30-1:00] Register Batch**
> "First, let's register a new coffee batch. I'll upload a photo, enter the origin, and submit. Watchâ€”within 800 milliseconds, Gemini AI analyzes the image, detects quality tags like 'organic' and 'premium', and flags any anomalies. This data is then submitted to Hedera HCS for immutable timestamping."

**[1:00-1:30] Tokenize with AI Summary**
> "Next, I'll tokenize this batch by creating an NFT certificate. The AI reads the entire HCS timelineâ€”planting, maintenance, harvestâ€”and generates a provenance summary in both English and French. It also calculates a trust score of 95/100 based on completeness and verification. This takes just 1.5 seconds."

**[1:30-2:00] Verify & Buyer Q&A**
> "Finally, let's verify the batch. Here's the complete timeline with clickable blockchain transaction links. Now watch thisâ€”I can ask questions in natural language: 'When was this harvested?' The AI answers instantly with evidence from the blockchain, citing specific transaction IDs. This is perfect for buyers who want transparency without technical knowledge."

**[2:00] Closing**
> "That's AgriTrustâ€”fast, intelligent, and built on Hedera. Thank you!"

## Judge Instructions

### What to Click

1. **Health Check** (verify AI is working)
   - Visit: http://localhost:4000/api/health/full
   - Look for: `gemini: { ok: true, model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp", ms: <number> }`

2. **Register a Batch**
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173/register
